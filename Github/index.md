# Github: The Basics

Think of Github as the Facebook for those who write code. You want to share your code (_create a repository_), you want to like someone's code (_starring repositories_), you want to jump into conversations about code because they might have a bug (_to submit an issue_). Your future employer might also ask for your Github, so building your Github presence is like building a portfolio. But at its core is Git, which is a version control system. In a team setting, you will be able to independently and parallely work on a code and later on _merge_ the changes into a single file. These parallel workflows are called _branches_. I will walk you through some of the concepts and techniques that lay the foundation for you to master Github.
