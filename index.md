**Tensorflow: The Basics**

_Mar 12 3:30 PM_

Tensorflow is crucial in building neural networks faster. However, the basics of Tensorflow may be confusing as building, training, testing models arenâ€™t that straightforward. Come to this session to learn about placeholders, variables, graphs, and sessions. In the end we will build a rudimentary regression model to put into practice your knowledge of Tensorflow. This workshop is the first of the Tensorflow workshop series in which Deep Neural Networks and Recurrent Neural Networks will be explored. The Basics workshops lays down the foundation for the subsequent two workshops.
